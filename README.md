# API-First company

We are building Monite as an API-First company. While doing so, we collect and create a lot of knowledge that we are eager to share with a broader tech community.

This repository contains our collection of tips and best practices on how to build an API-First company. Feel free to share it, reuse it, and suggest your own input on what else can be there too.
